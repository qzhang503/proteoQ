\arguments{
\item{group_psm_by}{A character string specifying the method in PSM grouping.
At the \code{pep_seq} default, descriptive statistics will be calculated
based on the same \code{pep_seq} groups. At the \code{pep_seq_mod}
alternative, peptides with different variable modifications will be treated
as different species and descriptive statistics will be calculated based on
the same \code{pep_seq_mod} groups.}

\item{group_pep_by}{A character string specifying the method in peptide
grouping. At the \code{prot_acc} default, descriptive statistics will be
calculated based on the same \code{prot_acc} groups. At the \code{gene}
alternative, proteins with the same gene name but different accession
numbers will be treated as one group.}

\item{mc_psm_by}{A character string specifying the method in the median
centering of PSM \code{log2FC} across samples. At the \code{peptide}
default, PSMs will be grouped according to \code{group_psm_by} and the
medians under each \code{group_psm_by} will be used for the median
centering. At the \code{psm} alternative, PSMs will be median centered
without grouping.}

\item{fasta}{Character string(s) to the name(s) of fasta file(s) with
prepended directory path. The \code{fasta} database(s) need to match those
used in MS/MS ion search. There is no default and users need to provide the
correct file path(s) and name(s).}

\item{expt_smry}{A character string to the \code{.xlsx} file containing the
metadata of TMT experiments. The default is \code{expt_smry.xlsx}.}

\item{rm_krts}{Logical; if TRUE, keratin entries will be removed. The default
is FALSE.}

\item{plot_rptr_int}{Logical; if TRUE, the distributions of reporter-ion
intensities will be plotted. The default is TRUE.}

\item{plot_log2FC_cv}{Logical; if TRUE, the distributions of the CV of peptide
\code{log2FC} will be plotted. The default is TRUE.}

\item{use_lowercase_aa}{Logical; if TRUE, modifications in amino acid
residues will be abbreviated with lower-case and/or \code{^_~}. See the
table below for details. The default is TRUE.}

\item{...}{Not currently used.}
