\title{Calculates numeric values}
\usage{
calc_tmt_nums(df, filelist, group_psm_by)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame of PSM.}

\item{filelist}{A list of PSM files.}

\item{group_psm_by}{A character string specifying the method in PSM grouping.
At the \code{pep_seq} default, descriptive statistics will be calculated
based on the same \code{pep_seq} groups. At the \code{pep_seq_mod}
alternative, peptides with different variable modifications will be treated
as different species and descriptive statistics will be calculated based on
the same \code{pep_seq_mod} groups.}
}
\description{
Spreads fields of numeric values: sd_log2_R, log2_R, log2_R, I, N_I by TMT
sets. Also works for LFQ as each sample corresponds to a TMT set.
