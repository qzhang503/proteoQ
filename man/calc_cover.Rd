\usage{
calc_cover(df, id, fasta = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{The name of a primary data file. By default, it will be determined
automatically after matching the types of data and analysis with an
\code{id} among \code{c("pep_seq", "pep_seq_mod", "prot_acc", "gene")}. A
primary file contains normalized peptide or protein data and is among
\code{c("Peptide.txt", "Peptide_pVal.txt", "Peptide_impNA_pVal.txt",
"Protein.txt", "Protein_pVal.txt", "protein_impNA_pVal.txt")}. For analyses
require the fields of significance p-values, the \code{df} will be one of
\code{c("Peptide_pVal.txt", "Peptide_impNA_pVal.txt", "Protein_pVal.txt",
"protein_impNA_pVal.txt")}.}

\item{id}{Character string; one of \code{pep_seq}, \code{pep_seq_mod},
\code{prot_acc} and \code{gene}.}

\item{fasta}{Character string(s) to the name(s) of fasta file(s) with
prepended directory path. The \code{fasta} database(s) need to match those
used in MS/MS ion search. There is no default and users need to provide the
correct file path(s) and name(s).}
