\usage{
ok_min_size(df, min_delta, gspval_cutoff, gslogFC_cutoff)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{The name of a primary data file. By default, it will be determined
automatically after matching the types of data and analysis with an
\code{id} among \code{c("pep_seq", "pep_seq_mod", "prot_acc", "gene")}. A
primary file contains normalized peptide or protein data and is among
\code{c("Peptide.txt", "Peptide_pVal.txt", "Peptide_impNA_pVal.txt",
"Protein.txt", "Protein_pVal.txt", "protein_impNA_pVal.txt")}. For analyses
require the fields of significance p-values, the \code{df} will be one of
\code{c("Peptide_pVal.txt", "Peptide_impNA_pVal.txt", "Protein_pVal.txt",
"protein_impNA_pVal.txt")}.}

\item{min_delta}{Numeric value or vector; the minimum count difference between
the up- and the down-expressed group of proteins for consideration in gene
set tests. For example at \code{min_delta = 4}, a gene set will 6
upregulated proteins and 2 down-expressed proteins, or vice versa, will be
assessed. The number is after data filtration by \code{pval_cutoff},
\code{logFC_cutoff} or varargs expressions under \code{filter_}. The default
is 4 for all formulas matched to or specified in argument \code{fml_nms}.
Formula-specific threshold is allowed by supplying a vector of sizes.}

\item{gspval_cutoff}{Numeric value or vector; the cut-off in gene-set
significance \code{pVal}. Only enrichment terms with \code{pVals} more
significant than the threshold will be reported. The default is 0.05 for all
formulas matched to or specified in argument \code{fml_nms}.
Formula-specific threshold is allowed by supplying a vector of cut-off
values.}

\item{gslogFC_cutoff}{Numeric value or vector; the cut-off in gene-set
enrichment fold change. Only enrichment terms with absolute fold change
greater than the threshold will be reported. The default magnitude is
\code{log2(1.2)} for all formulas matched to or specified in argument
\code{fml_nms}. Formula-specific threshold is allowed by supplying a vector
of absolute values in \code{log2FC}.}
