\arguments{
\item{df}{The name of a primary data file. By default, it will be determined
automatically after matching the types of data and analysis with an
\code{id} among \code{c("pep_seq", "pep_seq_mod", "prot_acc", "gene")}. A
primary file contains normalized peptide or protein data and is among
\code{c("Peptide.txt", "Peptide_pVal.txt", "Peptide_impNA_pVal.txt",
"Protein.txt", "Protein_pVal.txt", "protein_impNA_pVal.txt")}. For analyses
require the fields of significance p-values, the \code{df} will be one of
\code{c("Peptide_pVal.txt", "Peptide_impNA_pVal.txt", "Protein_pVal.txt",
"protein_impNA_pVal.txt")}.}

\item{id}{Currently only "entrez".}

\item{fml_nm}{A character string; the name of \code{fml}.}

\item{col_ind}{Numeric vector; the indexes of columns for the ascribed \code{fml_nm}.}

\item{pval_cutoff}{Numeric value or vector; the cut-off in protein
significance \code{pVal}. Entries with \code{pVals} less significant than
the threshold will be excluded from enrichment analysis. The default is 0.05
for all formulas matched to or specified in argument \code{fml_nms}.
Formula-specific threshold is allowed by supplying a vector of cut-off
values.}

\item{logFC_cutoff}{Numeric value or vector; the cut-off in protein
\code{log2FC}. Entries with absolute \code{log2FC} smaller than the
threshold will be excluded from enrichment analysis. The default magnitude
is \code{log2(1.2)} for all formulas matched to or specified in argument
\code{fml_nms}. Formula-specific threshold is allowed by supplying a vector
of absolute values in \code{log2FC}.}
