\arguments{
\item{df}{The name of a primary data file. By default, it will be determined
automatically after matching the types of data and analysis with an
\code{id} among \code{c("pep_seq", "pep_seq_mod", "prot_acc", "gene")}. A
primary file contains normalized peptide or protein data and is among
\code{c("Peptide.txt", "Peptide_pVal.txt", "Peptide_impNA_pVal.txt",
"Protein.txt", "Protein_pVal.txt", "protein_impNA_pVal.txt")}. For analyses
require the fields of significance p-values, the \code{df} will be one of
\code{c("Peptide_pVal.txt", "Peptide_impNA_pVal.txt", "Protein_pVal.txt",
"protein_impNA_pVal.txt")}.}

\item{id}{Character string; one of \code{pep_seq}, \code{pep_seq_mod},
\code{prot_acc} and \code{gene}.}

\item{label_scheme_sub}{A data frame. Subset entries from \code{label_scheme}
for selected samples.}

\item{anal_type}{Character string; the type of analysis that are preset for
method dispatch in function factories. The value will be determined
automatically. Exemplary values include \code{anal_type = c("PCA",
"Corrplot", "EucDist", "GSPA", "Heatmap", "Histogram", "MDS", "Model",
"NMF", "Purge", "Trend", "LDA", ...)}.}

\item{scale_log2r}{Logical; if TRUE, adjusts \code{log2FC} to the same scale
of standard deviation across all samples. The default is TRUE.}

\item{center_features}{Logical; if TRUE, adjusts log2FC to center zero by
features (proteins or peptides). The default is TRUE. Note the difference to
data alignment with \code{method_align} in \code{\link[proteoQ]{standPrn}}
or \code{\link[proteoQ]{standPep}} where log2FC are aligned by observations
(samples).}

\item{scale_features}{Logical; if TRUE, adjusts log2FC to the same scale of
variance by features (proteins or peptides). The default is TRUE. Note the
difference to data scaling with \code{scale_log2r} where log2FC are scaled
by observations (samples).}

\item{adjEucDist}{Logical; if TRUE, adjusts the inter-plex \code{Euclidean}
distance by \eqn{1/sqrt(2)} at \code{method = "euclidean"}. The option
\code{adjEucDist = TRUE} may be suitable when \code{reference samples} from
each TMT plex undergo approximately the same sample handling process as the
samples of interest. For instance, \code{reference samples} were split at
the levels of protein lysates. Typically, \code{adjEucDist = FALSE} if
\code{reference samples} were split near the end of a sample handling
process, for instance, at the stages immediately before or after TMT
labeling. Also see online
\href{https://github.com/qzhang503/proteoQ}{README, section MDS} for a brief
reasoning.}

\item{classical}{Logical. Metric MDS will be performed at TRUE and non-metric
MDS at FALSE (see also \code{\link[stats]{cmdscale}} and
\code{\link[MASS]{isoMDS}}). The default is TRUE.}

\item{method}{Character string; the distance measure in
\code{\link[stats]{dist}}. The default method is "euclidean".}

\item{p}{Numeric; The power of the Minkowski distance in
\code{\link[stats]{dist}}. The default is 2.}

\item{k}{Numeric; The desired dimension for the solution passed to
\code{\link[stats]{cmdscale}}. The default is 3.}

\item{col_group}{Character string to a column key in \code{expt_smry.xlsx}.
Samples corresponding to non-empty entries under \code{col_group} will be
used for sample grouping in the indicated analysis. At the NULL default, the
column key \code{Group} will be used. No data annotation by groups will be
performed if the fields under the indicated group column is empty.}

\item{folds}{Not currently used. Integer; the degree of folding data into
subsets. The default is one without data folding.}

\item{out_file}{A file path object to an output file.}

\item{...}{\code{filter_}: Variable argument statements for the row filtration
against data in a primary file linked to \code{df}. See also
\code{\link{normPSM}} for the format of \code{filter_} statements. \cr \cr
Additional parameters for \code{ggsave}: \cr \code{width}, the width of
plot; \cr \code{height}, the height of plot \cr \code{...}}
