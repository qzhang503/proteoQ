Header	Descrption	Note
prot_acc	Protein accession string	Mascot
prot_desc	Protein description taken from Fasta title line	Mascot
prot_mass	Protein mass	Mascot
prot_matches_sig	Count of PSMs that have significant scores under a proposed protein	Cf. PSM keys
prot_sequences_sig	Count of distinct sequences that have significant scores under a proposed protein	Cf. PSM keys
prot_cover	Protein sequence coverage	Cf. PSM keys
prot_n_psm	Count of significant PSMs in quantitation under a proposed protein	Joint results from processed PSM tables; the counts exclude entries that are void in reporter-ion intensity or filtered by users
prot_n_pep	Count of significant peptide sequences in quantitation under a proposed protein	Cf. 'prot_n_psm'
pep_seq	One-letter representation of peptide sequences	Cf. PSM keys; the key will become 'pep_seq_mod' at 'normPSM(group_psm_by = pep_seq_mod)'
pep_seq_mod	'pep_seq' with variable modifications in the lower cases	Cf. PSM keys; the key will become 'pep_seq' at 'normPSM(group_psm_by = pep_seq)'
pep_n_psm	Counts of significant PSMs in quantitation under a proposed peptide	Cf. 'prot_n_psm'

pep_end	Mascot: ordinal position of last peptide residue in protein sequence	Cf. 'pep_start'
pep_miss	Count of missed cleavage sites in peptide	Mascot
pep_calc_mr	Molecular mass calculated from matched peptide sequence	Mascot
pep_rank	Peptide sequence match (PSM) rank. If two PSMs have same score they have the same rank.	Median description from PSMs
pep_isbold	"If grouping enabled, then a significant PSM; otherwise, indicates this is the highest scoring protein that contains a match to this query."	Cf. 'pep_rank'
pep_exp_mz	"Observed or experimental m/z value
"	Cf. 'pep_rank'
pep_exp_mr	"Molecular mass calculated from experimental m/z value
"	Cf. 'pep_rank'
pep_exp_z	"Observed or experimental charge
"	Cf. 'pep_rank'
