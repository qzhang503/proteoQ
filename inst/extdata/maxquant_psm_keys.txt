prot_acc	Protein accession string	`Proteins` in MaxQuant
prot_desc	Protein description taken from Fasta title line	
prot_mass	Protein mass	
prot_len	The number of amino acid residues under a proposed protein	
prot_cover	Protein sequence coverage	Calculated from the union of individual data sources
prot_n_psm	Count of significant PSMs in quantitation under a proposed protein	By each TMT experiment and LC/MS series; the counts exclude entries that are void in reporter-ion intensity or filtered by users
prot_n_pep	Count of significant peptide sequences in quantitation under a proposed protein	Cf. `prot_n_psm`
pep_seq	One-letter representation of peptide sequences	"The acetylations of protein N-terminals is indicated by '_' and the flanking residues on the N- or C-terminal side of peptides separated by '.', e.g. ""-._MASGVAVSDGVIK.V"""
pep_seq_mod	'pep_seq' with variable modifications in the lower cases	"E.g. ""-._mAsGVAVSDGVIK.V"" with a methionine oxidation and a serine phosphorylation"
pep_isunique	"Peptide sequence is unique at the levels of protein groups, protein IDs or none"	Cf. proteoQ help document via `?normPSM`
pep_res_before	Flanking residue on N-term side of peptide	
pep_start	Ordinal position of first peptide residue in protein sequence	
pep_end	Ordinal position of last peptide residue in protein sequence	
pep_res_after	Flanking residue on C-term side of peptide	
pep_n_psm	Counts of significant PSMs in quantitation under a proposed peptide	Cf. `prot_n_psm`
raw_file	MS file name(s) where peptides or proteins are identified	
m/z	The mass-over-charge of the precursor ion.	From MaxQuant
acc_type	The type of accession names	"One of `refseq_acc`, `uniprot_acc` or `uniprot_id`"
uniprot_id	Uniprot ID	Optional for UniProt Fasta; the key will become `uniprot_acc` if the primary one is `uniprot_id`
entrez	Protein Entrez ID	
gene	Protein gene name	
species	The species of a protein entry	
kin_attr	The attribute of proteins being kinases	"Optional at `normPSM(annot_kinases = TRUE, ...)`"
kin_class	"The classes of kinases, e.g., TK, TKL..."	Cf. `kin_attr`
kin_order	"The order of ""kin_class"" from the kinase tree diagram"	Cf. `kin_attr`
is_tryptic	Logical indicating if a sequence belongs to a canonical tryptic peptide	
...	More column keys from MaxQuant	Cf. http://www.coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=maxquant:table:msmstable
I126 etc.	Reporter-ion intensity	Corrected or uncorrected from MaxQuant; c.f. `?normPSM`
N_I126 etc.	Normalized reporter-ion intensity	The calibration factors for the alignment of log2FC are used to scale the reporter-ion intensity
sd_log2_R126 etc.	Standard deviation of peptide log2FC 	Calculated from contributing PSMs under each TMT channel
R126 etc.	Linear FC relative to TMT-126	
log2_R126 etc.	log2FC in relative to the average intensity of reference(s) under each multiplex TMT	Relative to the row-mean intensity within each multiplex TMT if no reference(s) are present
