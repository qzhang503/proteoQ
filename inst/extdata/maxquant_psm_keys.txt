prot_len	The number of amino acid residues under a proposed protein	
prot_cover	Protein sequence coverage	Calculated from the union of individual data sources
prot_n_psm	Count of significant PSMs in quantitation under a proposed protein	By each TMT experiment and LC/MS series; the counts exclude entries that are void in reporter-ion intensity or filtered by users
prot_n_pep	Count of significant peptide sequences in quantitation under a proposed protein	Cf. 'prot_n_psm'

pep_end	Ordinal position of last peptide residue in protein sequence	
pep_res_after	Flanking residue on C-term side of peptide	
pep_n_psm	Counts of significant PSMs in quantitation under a proposed peptide	Cf. 'prot_n_psm'
raw_file	MS file name(s) where peptides or proteins are identified	
m/z	The mass-over-charge of the precursor ion.	From MaxQuant
acc_type	The type of accession names	"One of 'refseq_acc', 'uniprot_acc' or 'uniprot_id'"
