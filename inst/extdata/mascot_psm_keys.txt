pep_...	Additional peptide keys from Mascot PSM exports by users	Mascot only.
pep_locprob	The highest probablity from the Mascot site analysis of the variable modification sites	"Mascot oprional with the selection of `Query Level Information` during  PSM export. The second highest probablity, `pep_locprob2` is made implicit through `pep_locdiff`. Cf. `pep_var_mod_conf` from Mascot."
