Header	Descrption	Note
prot_matches_sig	Count of PSMs that have significant scores under a proposed protein	Joint Mascot 'prot_matches_sig' from individual data sources; PSMs with void reporter-ion intensity are included.
prot_sequences_sig	Count of distinct sequences that have significant scores under a proposed protein	Joint Mascot 'prot_sequences_sig' from individual data sources; the counts may be greater than 'prot_sequences' when peptides with different variable modifications are treated as different species
prot_n_psm	Count of significant PSMs in quantitation under a proposed protein	By TMT experiment and LC/MS series; the counts exclude entries that are void in reporter-ion intensity or filtered by users
prot_n_pep	Count of significant peptide sequences in quantitation under a proposed protein	Cf. 'prot_n_psm'
pep_seq	One-letter representation of peptide sequences	"The acetylations of protein N-terminals is indicated by '_' and the flanking residues on the N- or C-terminal side of peptides separated by '.', e.g. ""-._MASGVAVSDGVIK.V"""
pep_seq_mod	'pep_seq' with variable modifications in the lower cases	"E.g. ""-._mAsGVAVSDGVIK.V"" with a methionine oxidation and a serine phosphorylation"
pep_n_psm	Counts of significant PSMs in quantitation under a proposed peptide	Cf. 'prot_n_psm'
raw_file	MS file name(s) where peptides or proteins are identified	
length	The number of amino acid residues under a proposed protein	
acc_type	The type of accession names	
entrez	Protein Entrez ID	
gene	Protein gene name	
species	The species of a protein entry	
kin_attr	The attribute of proteins being kinases	"Optional at 'normPSM(annot_kinases = TRUE, ...)'"
kin_class	"The classes of kinases, e.g., TK, TKL..."	Cf. 'kin_attr'
kin_order	"The order of ""kin_class"" from the kinase tree diagram"	Cf. 'kin_attr'
I126 et al.	Reporter-ion intensity from MS/MS ion search	
N_I126 et al.	Normalized reporter-ion intensity	The calibration factors for the alignment of log2FC are used to scale the reporter-ion intensity
sd_log2_R126 et al.	Standard deviation of peptide log2FC 	The s.d. of peptide log2FC are calculated from contributing PSMs
R126 et al.	Linear FC relative to TMT-126	
log2_R126 et al.	log2FC relative to TMT-126	
N_log2_R126 et al.	Median-centered log2FC relative to TMT-126
